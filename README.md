super-suggestotron
==================

Right now, this is a basic Rails application, one tiny step removed from the end product of the ["Intro to Rails"](http://docs.railsbridge.org/intro-to-rails/) RailsBridge project. If you've been to a RailsBridge workshop, you probably have your own already.

I just came from mentoring at a RailsBridge event and I was frustrated that, at the end of the project, I couldn't think of a good, open-source Rails project to point our students to as an example of what might be "next" for them.

But I had an idea: as it happens, the company I work for needs something that sounds a _little_ bit like Suggestotron -- well, like a "super Suggestotron" (hence the name of this repository).

### The Idea

Our team has these big, weekly meetings. Someone gives a short presentation, but then there's a lot of Q&A after. Most of our team are widely distributed, so we're streaming video and audio of the presentation. Currently, remote people ask questions in Campfire or maybe add them to a Google Doc, but both of those have problems.

What we need, is a way for people to submit questions and vote questions to the top of the list of questions to ask.

Sounds like Suggestotron, right? If you squint at `topics`, they are kind of like "questions", and we already have voting. We're almost there, right?

So, here's what I'll do:

* Make a list of things we'd like this app to do
* File [Issues](issues) in this repository with those things
* Label each issue with helpful tags, like the likely difficulty level

This is where **you** get involved and help make things happen:

* Post a comment on an issue you want to work on, so we know what's up
* Fork the repository
* Submit a Pull Request

(If you're confused about forking and pulling on GitHub, check out [Git-It](https://github.com/jlord/git-it) which is a great introduction to git and GitHub.)

If you're a mentor, or not a novice Rails developer, you could help:

* See features that could use work? Submit more issues!
* Have new pull requests come in? Provide [constructive feedback](http://exercism.io/help/nitpick) or a hearty :+1:
* Have some time? You could volunteer to [pair program](http://www.pairprogramwith.me) with a beginner!

# I have no idea what I'm doing.

This is all new to me. It's very likely it won't work, for one reason or another. But I thought I'd give it a whirl. If nothing else, _I'll_ learn something.
